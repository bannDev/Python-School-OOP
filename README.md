# Python-School-OOP
I wrote a python project using object oriented programming for the first time.

Project Description:
This program creates a class registration system.  It allows users to log in as students or administrators.  A student user can add courses, drop courses and list courses he/she has registered for.  An administrator user can show class rosters and change maximum class sizes.  

My Objectives for this project:
- How to apply object oriented design
- How to create modules and functions
- How to create and use objects
- How to store data in lists
- How to create and use selection control structures
- How to create and use iterative control structures
- How to add comments to Python code

My goals:
- Apply object-oriented design
- Create modules and functions
- Create and use objects
- Store data in lists
- Create and use selection control structures
- Create and use iterative control structures
- Add comments to Python code

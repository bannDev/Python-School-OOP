# Python-School-OOP
I wrote a python project using object oriented programming for the first time.

Project Description:
This program creates a class registration system.  It allows users to log in as students or administrators.  A student user can add courses, drop courses and list courses he/she has registered for.  An administrator user can show class rosters and change maximum class sizes.
